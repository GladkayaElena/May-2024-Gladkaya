    <p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scottish_novelists">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie">J. M. Barrie.</a> A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having
        adventures on the mythical island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Neverland</a> as the leader of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Boys_(Peter_Pan)">Lost Boys</a>, interacting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy">fairies</a>,

    <p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism">escapism</a>. In addition to two distinct
        works by Barrie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird"><i>The Little White Bird</i></a> (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a> in 1906), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre">West End stage</a> play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy"><i>Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a> (1904, which expanded into the 1911
        novel<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and Wendy</a>), the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and
        expanding on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other works.</p>

    <p>Barrie commissioned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_statue">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frampton">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in

    <p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird"><i>The Little White Bird</i></a> (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters
        13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as
        "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre
        of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_play">stage play</a> titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy"><i>Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">Duke of
        York's Theatre</a> in London.<sup style="color: blue">[3]</sup> Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton,
        extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens"><i>Peter Pan
        in Kensington Gardens</i></a>, with the addition of illustrations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a>.<sup style="color: blue">[4]</sup> Barrie later adapted and expanded the
        1904 play's storyline as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy"><i>Peter and Wendy</i></a>.</p>

    <p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating
        accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<sup style="color: blue">[5]</sup></p>
